# aerospaceviz

This D3.js visualization helps to explore the Seattle Aerospace industry.

I first loaded the graph data on Gephi, and played with it. After getting some insights into the data, I tried to come up with potential users.
Some of them I envisioned, was the government, a stockholder, an early stage startup.

I explored how to augment the data, and I got a list of companies that I could potentially use. In order to save time, I started the D3.js project.
I coded the initial force-directed graph, by looking at examples, and tweaked it a lot.

I added some functionality that I hypothesized to be useful to my potential users. I will iterate and iterate, do some usability testing, to make it better.
